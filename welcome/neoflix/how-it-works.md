# How it works

Adding video review to healthcare workflows can create long-term efficiencies despite initial time investments. Although it may seem counterintuitive to add tasks to already busy schedules, properly implemented video review programs can possibly streamline processes and create valuable opportunities for improvement.

### [Fundamentals](broken-reference/)

Successful implementation starts with assembling a dedicated team and designing a process that is safe, straightforward, and initially limited in scope. Begin by identifying key stakeholders across different disciplines who can champion the initiative and provide diverse perspectives.

Careful planning is essential to address privacy concerns and time constraints. Develop clear protocols for patient consent, data security, and video access. Start with a pilot program in a single department or for specific procedures to refine the process before wider implementation.

Consider the existing workflow and look for natural points where video recording can be integrated with minimal disruption. Engage staff early in the planning process to address concerns and gather input on practical implementation strategies.

Modern technology has significantly simplified the recording process in medical settings. Options include smartphones, specialized glasses, or fixed cameras, each with its own advantages depending on the specific procedure and environment.

With proper setup and staff engagement, recording can become a routine part of procedures. Provide thorough training on equipment use and recording protocols to ensure consistency and quality. Emphasize the potential benefits, such as enhanced training for new professionals and improved team collaboration, to encourage staff buy-in.

Establish clear guidelines for when and how to record, including any pre-procedure checklists or post-procedure tagging systems to organize the collected video data effectively.

Video review facilitates knowledge sharing among colleagues in a way that verbal descriptions or written notes cannot match. By examining recorded procedures together, teams can identify best practices and areas for improvement with a level of detail and objectivity that was previously difficult to achieve.

Set up regular review sessions where team members can discuss recorded procedures in a constructive, non-judgmental environment. Encourage open dialogue and the sharing of insights from different perspectives. This collaborative approach often leads to refined techniques and enhanced patient care as team members learn from each other's experiences and observations.

Consider developing a structured format for these review sessions to ensure they remain focused and productive. This might include specific criteria for evaluation or a system for categorizing observations and recommendations.

### [<mark style="color:blue;">**Refine**</mark>](../../level-2-in-action/refine.md)

Team-wide video analysis allows for the combination of diverse perspectives and expertise. Providers can pinpoint specific areas for improvement in their practices, from technical skills to communication and teamwork dynamics.

Use the insights gained from video review to develop targeted improvement plans. This might involve modifying protocols, adjusting equipment setups, or focusing on particular aspects of a procedure during training sessions.

Track changes and improvements over time by comparing videos of similar procedures. This data-driven approach to refinement directly contributes to higher quality care and can be a powerful tool for demonstrating the value of the video review program to leadership and stakeholders.

## Neoflix: record, reflect, refine

The Neoflix 'Record, Reflect, Refine' framework provides a structured approach to video review in healthcare settings. By following these steps and adapting them to your specific environment, you can create a sustainable and effective video review program that enhances both individual and team performance.

Remember that implementing such a program is an iterative process. Regularly solicit feedback from participants and be prepared to adjust your approach as you learn what works best for your organization. With patience and persistence, video review can become a valuable tool for continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.
