# Quick-start

Video review is a tool for enhancing performance, promoting collaboration, and identifying areas for improvement. This quick-start guide outlines the essential steps to implement video review in your workflow.

## **Getting started**

### **1. Planning**

Define specific goals for your video review process, such as skill improvement or process efficiency. Gain support from colleagues and management by explaining the benefits and potential outcomes. Develop a clear policy addressing privacy concerns, including consent procedures and guidelines for video storage and access.

* [ ] **Set Goals:** Determine what you want to achieve with video review (e.g., skill improvement, process efficiency).
* [ ] **Secure Support:** Explain the benefits to colleagues and management to gain their buy-in. Make sure the team is prepared and have multiple meetings to explain the goal of video review to all involved providers. Make sure to inform management staff and obtain permission.
* [ ] **Address Privacy:** Draft a clear policy on consent, video storage, and access. Click [here ](../../level-1-fundamentals/3.-safe-simple-and-small)for more information.

Additionally, you might not receive the necessary support from management.</mark></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### 2. Pilot test

Form a pilot team of providers willing to participate in the first recordings. Select a routine, low-risk task for the initial recording to minimize pressure. Use readily available equipment like smartphones for recording, seeking technical assistance if needed.

* [ ] **Form your** [**pioneer team**](../../level-1-fundamentals/2.-planning-your-initiative/2.1-pioneer-team.md)**.** These are providers who are involved in the video review program, willing to be the first to be recorded and who can convey the message of video review to the team.
* [ ] **Choose a Low-Stakes Task:** Start with a familiar, routine procedure for your first recording.
* [ ] **Keep Setup Simple:** Use a smartphone or enlist tech help if needed.
* [ ] **Watch and Learn:** Review the video with those involved, focus on positives, and identify areas for growth.

### **3. First review session**

Establish feedback rules to maintain a safe learning environment. Focus on specific behaviors and situations without personal judgments. Begin the session by emphasizing the learning objectives and thanking participants. Guide the discussion to draw insights from the video, and conclude by summarizing key takeaways.

* [ ] **Feedback rules:** The most important part of organizing video review, is maintaining the safe learning environment.
  * You can enhance this by using feedback rules, i.e., be specific and to the point, focus on behavior and do not make it personal, describe the situation without judgement.
* [ ] **Set a Positive Tone:** Emphasize learning and improvement in a supportive space.
* [ ] **Thank Participants:** Acknowledge the value of those who agreed to be recorded.
* [ ] **Facilitate Discussion:** Guide participants to share insights from the video.
* [ ] **End with Takeaways:** Summarize key learnings.

### **Reflect and expand**

After the initial session, gather feedback from participants on the effectiveness of the review and their experience with the process. Use this input to refine your approach and develop guidelines for a broader implementation of video review.

* [ ] **Get Team Feedback:** Evaluate the session's effectiveness by making an overview on lessons learned and identified areas for improvement. Ask for your team's feedback on the session, on what they learned from the session and how they experienced the safe learning environment.
* [ ] **Build Your Program:** Based on the pilot and your team's feedback, develop guidelines and expand your video review program.

## **A few more tips**

#### **Initiating the process**

At first, start with brief recordings of basic tasks. This approach allows for manageable analysis and gradual skill development.

#### **Constructive feedback**

Focus on identifying and reinforcing positive aspects of performance. While addressing areas for improvement, maintain a balanced perspective that acknowledges existing competencies.

#### **Creating an analytical environment**

Establish a framework that encourages open discussion and reflection. Implement specific [feedback protocols](../../level-2-in-action/11.-lets-neoflix/11.3-tasks-of-the-chair.md) to ensure all participants feel comfortable sharing insights and receiving critiques.

Developing participants' understanding of video review practices is crucial. The provided [FAQs](faqs.md) serve as a valuable resource for this purpose. Reviewers and subjects alike should familiarize themselves with these materials to enhance the effectiveness of the review process.

As the review program progresses, consider gradually increasing the complexity and duration of recorded tasks. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment of skills and promotes continuous improvement over time.
