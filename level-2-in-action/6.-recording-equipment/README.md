# 6. Recording equipment

Emergency and intensive care environments are dynamic and unpredictable. While specialized recording equipment can be ideal, the ability to capture critical moments for review often depends on adaptability and accessibility. Prioritizing device flexibility allows for timely recording, maximizing learning opportunities:

* **Readily Available Devices:** Smartphones, tablets, and even existing patient monitoring systems often have recording capabilities. These readily available tools enable quick action when unexpected or high-stakes events occur.
* **Workflow Integration:** Using familiar devices streamlines the recording process, minimizing disruptions to critical care delivery and reducing stress for providers.
* **Adapting to Space Constraints:** Emergency situations can arise in varied locations with limited space. Flexible device options can be adapted to the environment, ensuring that valuable perspectives are captured.
* **Focus on Content, Not Just Quality:** While optimal video quality is desirable, the primary goal in emergent settings is to capture the content â€“ the actions, communication, and decision-making processes. This data holds immense value for reflection and improvement, even if the image resolution is not perfect.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Security and Privacy:** Ensure chosen devices are compliant with hospital policies for data security and patient privacy. Establish clear protocols for transfer, storage, and deletion of recordings.
* **Technical Aspects:** Brief training for staff on basic recording functions of available devices helps optimize capture quality and smooth workflow.

**Emphasis:** While specialized equipment offers advantages, prioritizing device flexibility empowers providers to record valuable learning experiences in the often-unpredictable world of emergency and intensive care.

## Options:

* [**Fixed Cameras:**](6.1-fixed-cameras.md) Strategically installed in procedure rooms or resuscitation bays offer overhead or wide-angle views, capturing the broader context of complex events. Ideal for established workflows with predictable patient positioning.
* [**Mobile Cameras**](6.2-mobile-cameras.md)**:** Mounted on tripods or carts, these provide adaptable perspectives, easily moved to different locations or to focus on specific actions during unexpected events.
* [**Wearable Cameras:**](6.3-wearable-cameras.md) Body-worn or head-mounted devices provide a first-person view of care, valuable for skill assessment and hands-on training. Useful for capturing detailed techniques and interactions.
* [**Patient Monitoring Systems**](6.4-patient-monitoring-systems.md)**:** Some existing monitoring systems have recording capabilities. These can supplement other views, potentially integrating video with vital signs and other physiological data for comprehensive analysis.
* [<mark style="color:blue;">**Motion-detecting cameras**</mark>](6.5-motion-detecting-cameras.md)<mark style="color:blue;">**:**</mark> Motion-detecting cameras streamline medical procedure recording, automatically capturing unexpected events.

{% tab title="GoPro / Action camera" %}


GoPro or comparable action cameras are renowned for their durability and rugged design, making them ideal for active use in challenging medical environments. Their wide-angle capabilities offer a distinct advantage by capturing a broader field of view, allowing viewers to gain a comprehensive understanding. Various accessories provide versatile mounting options, ensuring flexibility in capturing different angles and perspectives.

Due to the waterproof housing, audio quality may suffer, affecting the ability to capture clear and nuanced audio alongside the video recording. To enhance audio quality, explore the option of using an external microphone that can capture sound more accurately.

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Durability:** Designed for active use, GoPros are rugged and resilient.
* **Wide-Angle:** GoPros capture a broad field of view, showcasing more of the surgical area.
* **Waterproof:** Their waterproof design withstands sterilization methods involving moisture.
* **Mounting Options:** Accessories allow versatile mounting in various angles.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Fixed Focus:** GoPros may lack adjustable focus settings, affecting the depth of field.
* **Battery Life:** Depending on settings, battery life may be limited during extended procedures.

{% tab title="Smartphone/Tablet" %}


Smartphones have become nearly ubiquitous, eliminating the need for additional recording equipment. Their portability is a key advantage, allowing providers to quickly position the device for optimal recording angles. The user-friendly interfaces of smartphones make setup and recording intuitive, even for those less familiar with advanced camera equipment. Furthermore, modern smartphones are equipped with high-quality cameras that deliver clear and detailed visuals, enabling the capture of intricate surgical details for educational purposes.

Despite their convenience, smartphones have limitations. Manual controls for adjusting exposure and focus might be restricted compared to dedicated cameras, which can affect the quality of recorded footage in challenging lighting conditions. Extensive recording sessions, especially during lengthy procedures, can drain the smartphone's battery rapidly, necessitating careful battery management or backup power solutions. Additionally, recording handheld may lead to shaky footage, impacting the overall viewing experience for those who engage with the content.

To address stability issues during longer recording sessions, consider using a tripod or stabilizer to ensure steady footage. Activate privacy settings to prevent calls or notifications from disrupting the recording process.&#x20;

Lastly, bear in mind that the smartphone should not be for personal use, to avoid data leakage.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Ubiquitous:** Almost universally owned, smartphones eliminate the need for additional equipment.
* **Portability:** Their small size and weight make them easy to carry and position.
* **User-Friendly:** Familiar interfaces make setup and recording intuitive for most users.
* **High-Quality Cameras:** Modern smartphones boast advanced camera technology for clear visuals.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Limited Features:** Manual settings for exposure and focus may be restricted compared to dedicated cameras.
* **Battery Life:** Extensive recording sessions can deplete the battery rapidly, necessitating management.
* **Stabilization:** Handheld recording can introduce shaky footage, impacting viewing quality.
* **Privacy:** it could appear unprofessional to record procedures with a phone.&#x20;
