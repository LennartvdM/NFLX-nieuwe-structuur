# 10. Previewing

Previewing recorded procedures with the providers who were recorded, before in-depth plenary review during _Neoflix,_ maximizes learning potential and is essential for the safe learning environment. Here's how to strategically pre-screen medical videos.

**Creating a foundation for a focused and safe review session**

* **Safety First:** It creates a safe space for recorded providers to express potential concerns before a larger audience, fostering an environment of trust and open communication.
* **Insightful Sharing:** Providers gain the chance to share valuable context or insights about the situation, adding valuable depth for the team's understanding.
* **Focused Review:** By previewing the video, the review session can be more targeted. The team comes prepared with specific points of discussion or questions, maximizing the session's impact.

This preparatory step promotes a sense of collaboration and respect. It encourages constructive feedback, ultimately leading to a more productive and valuable learning experience for everyone involved.
