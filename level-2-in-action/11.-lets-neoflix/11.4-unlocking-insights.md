## **Unlocking the Power of Diverse Voices: Why Feedback Matters in Video Review**

Video review sessions offer a unique opportunity to analyze medical practices from multiple angles. Here's why gathering feedback from all participants is so crucial:

* **Perspectives are Powerful:** Every team member – doctors, nurses, specialists – brings their own unique experience and knowledge to the table. Their insights and questions add layers of understanding that no single person could offer alone.
* **Breaking Down Barriers:** While video analysis is a powerful learning tool, some participants might hesitate to speak up. Creating a safe and encouraging environment invites everyone to share their thoughts and concerns.
* **Collective Learning:** Open discussions reveal the reasoning behind decisions and illuminate potential challenges. This shared understanding leads to better communication and coordination in future critical situations.
* **Hidden Gems:** Even seemingly minor observations can lead to major improvements. By giving everyone a voice, we increase the chances of identifying areas for growth – things we might otherwise miss.

Remember, a video review session isn't just about finding flaws. It's a chance for the entire team to learn from each other and discover ways to provide even better patient care.

## Methods for Feedback:

1. **Verbal Feedback:**

* Guided Questions: Ask specific questions about decision points, communication, or unexpected events. Note what is said.
* "Plus/Delta": A quick way to glean positive aspects (+) and areas for change (Δ) in a structured way.
* Provider-Led: Allow recorded providers to initiate discussion points or areas they want feedback on. Don't let one provider only, decide what will be discussed, but make it a group effort.&#x20;
* Make sure to include everyone in the room in the discussion, putting emphasis on including providers from all disciplines involved in hands-on care.&#x20;

2. **Anonymous Questionnaire:**

Emphasis: Feedback is a two-way street. It not only enriches immediate review discussions but also informs the evolution of your video review program for maximum benefit to your team.

* **Quick and Easy:** Use a brief, anonymous questionnaire accessible via QR code. Distribute it immediately after each session for the freshest insights.
* **Targeted Questions:** Center your questions around these key areas:
  * **Participant Takeaways:** "What did you learn from this session?" Compare this to your own conclusions to assess knowledge transfer.
  * **Safe Space:** "Do you feel safe enough to express yourself and to voice your opinion?" (Scale of 1-5). This is crucial for productive learning.
  * **Open Feedback:** "What went well? What could be improved? Do you have suggestions for future Neoflix sessions?"
* **Essential Starter Questions:**
  * **Position:** "What is your position within the team?" (Options: Nurse, Doctor, Other)
  * **Feedback Rules:** "Is the use of feedback rules sufficient?" (Scale of 1-5, with rules clearly stated)
  * **Participation:** "Do you get enough opportunity to speak?" (Scale of 1-5)

**Why This Matters:** Honest participant feedback is the key to creating _Neoflix_ sessions that continuously evolve and provide maximum value to your team!

Anonymous feedback offers a safe space for sharing potentially sensitive insights and can encourage participation from those who might feel shy about speaking up in a group setting. This approach ensures that the focus remains on solutions relevant to the team's core concerns, fostering a collaborative learning environment where diverse insights lead to better, more sustainable improvements in patient care.</mark></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:red;">When you don't actively incorporate participant feedback during video review, you risk missing out on crucial insights and perspectives. The analysis could become one-sided, focusing on what facilitators observe but neglecting the experiences and challenges faced by providers. This can lead to solutions that don't address the team's core concerns or foster a sense of ownership. Without a safe space for open feedback, particularly for those who might be hesitant to speak up, valuable learning opportunities are lost. Ultimately, the video review process becomes less effective, hindering collaborative improvement efforts.</mark></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
