**Settings: Key camera settings for optimal video quality in medical settings**

* Resolution: Choose the highest your storage and workflow allow (at minimum 720p, ideally 1080p).
* Frame Rate: A minimum of 30 frames per second is necessary for smooth motion; consider 60fps if fast movement analysis is important.
* Lighting: If possible, manually adjust white balance and exposure to match the lighting conditions of the room.

**Auto-focus and Zoom: When and how to use these features effectively.**

* Auto-focus: Useful for maintaining focus on moving subjects, but be aware of potential distraction if it hunts significantly.
* Zoom: Best for planned close-ups â€“ pre-set or have a dedicated operator make adjustments. Avoid excessive zooming during a procedure, as it can disorient viewers.
