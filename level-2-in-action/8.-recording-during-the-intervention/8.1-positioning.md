# 8.1 Positioning

#### **Positioning: Optimal camera angles and placement for different procedures.**

* Overhead: Ceiling or wall-mounted fixed cameras provide a wide view for team dynamics and room layout analysis (e.g., trauma resuscitation).
* Close-up: Mobile or wearable cameras offer detailed views for skill analysis (e.g., suturing techniques, intubation).
* Multiple Angles: Consider combining perspectives to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the procedure.

**Minimize Disruption: Balancing recording needs with maintaining a natural workflow.**

* Pre-procedure setup: Prepare equipment in advance whenever possible.
* Dedicated Operator: If possible, assign a team member to manage the camera, freeing others to focus on patient care.
* Streamlined Workflow: Integrate recording into existing procedures where feasible.
