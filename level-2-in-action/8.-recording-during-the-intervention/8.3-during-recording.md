# 8.3 During recording

**5.5 Communication During Recording: How to acknowledge recording without impacting the patient experience.**

* Pre-procedure Announcement: A brief, clear statement before the procedure informs everyone (including patients if conscious) that recording is in progress.
* Minimize Verbal Cues: Avoid unnecessary commentary during recording; focus on essential communication related to patient care.
* Patient-Centered Approach: Prioritize patient comfort and privacy. If the patient expresses concern, address it sensitively or potentially stop recording if appropriate.

**Handling Complications or Deviations: How to navigate unexpected events while recording.**

* Documentation Goal: Remember, recordings capture real-world care, including complications. This data is valuable for analysis and improvement. Complications have to be reported regardless of wheter a video has been made.
* Don't Stop Prematurely or start too late: Unless necessary for patient safety, continue recording to document the response and management of the event, including the preparation and time-out.
* Post-Event Review: Use unforeseen events as especially rich learning opportunities in video review sessions.

**Capturing Patient Interactions: Recording consent processes and elements relevant to patient-provider dynamics.**

* Sensitivity: Prioritize patient privacy â€“ tailor camera angles and audio settings to respect confidentiality while still capturing essential interactions.
* Consent Documentation: If verbal consent is obtained, ensure the recording clearly captures the process.
* Valuable Insights: Observing patient-provider communication can reveal areas for improvement in fostering trust and shared decision-making.
