# REFLECT

The recording is done â€“ now the real learning begins! Get ready to dive into reflection. We'll start with previewing the video, introduce the Neoflix approach, and discuss how to create a safe and productive environment for video review. You'll also learn about the chairperson's role in guiding insightful discussions.

### Highlight of Reflect

The two most important sections of this level are [Previewing](6.-previewing.md) and [Let's Neoflix](7.-lets-neoflix/). Here, we will explain the importance and do's and don'ts of previewing a video before Neoflix. In addition, we will explain how to set up Neoflix to maximize safety and effectivity.&#x20;
