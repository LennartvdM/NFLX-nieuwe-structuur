Define clear objectives for the video review process. These may include improving specific procedures, enhancing teamwork, or identifying best practices. Communicate these goals effectively to all staff members, emphasizing how video review can contribute to professional development and improved patient care. Address any concerns or reservations team members might have about being recorded.

Select recording devices that are easy to use and suited to your practice's specific needs. Consider factors such as video quality, audio clarity, and ease of integration with existing systems. Evaluate different options for storing and accessing recorded content, ensuring that the chosen solution is secure and compliant with healthcare data regulations. Factor in the learning curve associated with new technology and plan for adequate training.

## Budget <a href="#budget" id="budget"></a>

Account for both immediate and long-term costs associated with implementing video review. Initial expenses may include purchasing recording equipment, storage solutions, and playback software. Ongoing costs to consider are potential upgrades, maintenance, and the time investment required for review sessions. Evaluate the return on investment in terms of improved patient outcomes and efficiency gains.

Plan how video review will fit into existing processes without creating excessive workload burdens. Identify suitable times for recording that don't disrupt patient care. Schedule review sessions at times that accommodate both medical and nursing staff, ensuring broad participation. Develop a system for selecting which procedures or interactions to record and review. Consider how findings from video reviews will be incorporated into practice improvements.
