Imagine a space where the NICU team comes together to share experiences, learn from one another, and continuously improve care for your tiniest patients. That's the power of _Neoflix_, a video review initiative built on collaboration and openness.

## **Building trust: the key to successful video review in healthcare** <a href="#building-trust-the-key-to-successful-video-review-in-healthcare" id="building-trust-the-key-to-successful-video-review-in-healthcare"></a>

Video review offers incredible potential to improve patient care, but it must be done in a way that fosters trust and respects the healthcare team. Here's how to create a positive, empowering environment:

### **1. Consent & transparency: the foundation of trust** <a href="#id-1.-consent-and-transparency-the-foundation-of-trust" id="id-1.-consent-and-transparency-the-foundation-of-trust"></a>

* **Clear communication:** Explain how videos will be used, who has access, and make sure patients and staff fully understand. Transparency eliminates uncertainty.
* **Open dialogue:** Discuss video plans with your team and invite their feedback. Their input shapes a process they feel invested in.

### **2. Collaboration for growth, not judgement** <a href="#id-2.-collaboration-for-growth-not-judgement" id="id-2.-collaboration-for-growth-not-judgement"></a>

* **Shared learning:** Emphasize video as a tool for collective improvement, not finding fault.
* **Respectful choice:** Opt-in systems allow staff to participate at their comfort level, building confidence.
* **Video is powerful, but not a cure-all:** True progress comes from a blend of tools, including mentorship and open communication.

### **3. Introducing video review: purpose, process, benefits** <a href="#id-3.-introducing-video-review-purpose-process-benefits" id="id-3.-introducing-video-review-purpose-process-benefits"></a>

* **Explain the why:** Share the vision – skill development and better care within a safe learning environment.
* **Clear process:** Outline the steps, who has access to videos, and how to voice any concerns.
* **The benefits:** Video offers objectivity, a broader view of care, and drives improvements in teamwork, quality, and processes.

Providers might feel that the process lacks clarity or is designed to find fault, leading to resistance and limited participation. Without establishing a non-judgmental atmosphere, anxieties may run high, stifling open communication and the potential for valuable learning. The result could be superficial analysis, ineffective solutions, and a missed opportunity to genuinely improve patient safety.</mark></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
