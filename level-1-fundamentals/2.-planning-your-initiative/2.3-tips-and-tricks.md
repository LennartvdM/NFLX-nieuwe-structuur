# 2.3 Resources

## **Resources & teamwork**

* **Helpful Tools:** Provide [supporting articles](../1.-preproduction/1.4-unburdening-the-process.md), presentations, and [FAQs](../../welcome/quick-start/faqs.md).
* **Defined Roles:** Establish who manages videos, chairs reviews, etc., including a [mix of disciplines](2.1-pioneer-team.md) for a well-rounded team.
* **Provider Control:** Voluntary participation and [consent at multiple stages](../3.-safe-simple-and-small#safe-obtaining-consent) keeps providers in control of their participation.
* **Addressing Concerns:** Listen actively and provide honest, transparent responses.
* **Collaborative Spirit:** Involve all relevant staff when scheduling reviews. Management support reinforces the initiative's importance.

## **Developing your own protocol**

The following protocol is an example that can be used to get management permission for implementing a video review pilot program:

<details>

<summary>Sample of a video review protocol for improving care</summary>

INTRODUCTION\
Video review offers a valuable tool for reflection and improvement in emergency or intensive care settings. This protocol outlines its implementation.\
\
GOAL\
Enhance quality of care through video review as an educational tool. Improve both technical and non-technical skills during emergency interventions.\


PREBRIEFING

* **Pre-briefing:**
  * Management informs staff (nursing & medical) about the pilot program, emphasizing a safe learning environment.
  * Gain staff buy-in through newsletters, handovers, and meetings.
* **Considerations:**
  * Importance of obtaining consent at all stages.
  * Maintaining patient privacy

PROCEDURE

1. **Before Intervention:**
   * Obtain consent from the entire team performing the intervention. (No recording if someone refuses)
   * Identify a recorder and camera position.
   * (Optional) Seek verbal consent from patient/family (when only used for quality assurance, not mandatory)
2. **Post-intervention:**
   * Standard post-briefing.
   * Re-obtain consent for video review (unused if refused)
   * Recordings stored on a secure server, accessible only to authorized personnel.
3. **Previewing by Caregivers:**
   * Obtain consent for using the video in the review session (unused if refused)

REVIEW

**Video Review Session:**

* **Focus:** Learning from successes and variations in care.
* **Duration:** Maximum 30 minutes
* **Timing:** 2-3 weeks after the procedure, during nurse handover (inviting medical staff)

POST-REVIEW

* Recordings deleted after use.
* Lessons learned inform future quality improvement initiatives.

**Medico-Legal Issues:**

* Incidents may be captured.
* Legal proceedings may require retaining evidence.
* Patient consent not mandatory for quality improvement (GDPR guidelines followed).
* All team members consented before/after recording and review. (Patient consent sought when possible).
* Legal counsel reviewed the protocol.
* Video data deleted after study completion.
* Standard practice includes video monitoring of patients in rooms.
* Recordings deemed an extension of standard care with patient consent (educational/research purposes).

**Informed Consent:**

* Not mandatory for quality improvement.
* Encouraged to obtain verbal consent from patients/families.
* Refusal to consent prevents recording.
* Triple consent process for caregivers ensures control throughout.

**Other considerations:**

* Hawthorne effect: potential for heightened performance (often positive) due to being observed.
