# 4. Learning from success stories

As video review programs become more widespread in healthcare institutions globally, hospitals are sharing their experiences and best practices. These insights offer valuable guidance for organizations looking to implement or enhance their own initiatives. The experiences of pioneering hospitals provide a roadmap for navigating the ethical, legal, and practical challenges associated with video review in medical settings.

Key considerations for successful implementation include developing robust consent protocols, ensuring patient privacy, managing data security, and creating effective review processes. By examining the approaches of established programs, healthcare organizations can learn how to address common obstacles such as staff hesitation or technical limitations.

The global adoption of video review highlights its universal applicability in healthcare. Despite differences in healthcare systems and cultural contexts, hospitals from various countries have successfully adapted this technology to their specific needs. This international collaboration fosters a rich exchange of ideas and methodologies, driving continuous improvement in patient care and medical training. Hospitals implementing video review often develop successful approaches to obtaining consent. These approaches include:

* **Clear Communication:** Providing patients and staff with detailed information about video recording, how it will be used, and their rights regarding consent.
* **Triple Provider Consent:** Obtaining consent from all team members involved in the procedure before recording, after recording, and before using the video for review.
* **Opt-in Systems:** Allowing staff to choose whether to participate in recording sessions based on their comfort level.
* **Respectful Dialogue:** Creating an environment where patients and staff feel comfortable asking questions and raising concerns about consent.

By prioritizing informed consent and learning from established practices, you can help ensure your video review program fosters trust, transparency, and continuous improvement in patient care. Below we highlight the set-up of four different centers who have successfully implemented video recording and reviewing in their unit.
