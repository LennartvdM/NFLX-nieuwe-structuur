# 4. Learning from success stories

Hospitals implementing video review often develop successful approaches to obtaining consent. These approaches often include:

* **Clear Communication:** Providing patients and staff with detailed information about video recording, how it will be used, and their rights regarding consent.
* **Triple Provider Consent:** Obtaining consent from all team members involved in the procedure before recording, after recording, and before using the video for review.
* **Opt-in Systems:** Allowing staff to choose whether to participate in recording sessions based on their comfort level.
* **Respectful Dialogue:** Creating an environment where patients and staff feel comfortable asking questions and raising concerns about consent.

By prioritizing informed consent and learning from established practices, you can help ensure your video review program fosters trust, transparency, and continuous improvement in patient care. Below we highlight the set-up of four different centers who have successfully implemented video recording and reviewing in their unit.
