#### Steps for Success <a href="#steps-for-success" id="steps-for-success"></a>

To implement video review effectively, medical teams can take several key steps:

1. Seek mentorship from institutions with established video review programs. Their experience can provide valuable guidance and support, streamlining the implementation process. You can find centers who have experience with video review in [Learning from success stories](../4.-learning-from-success-stories).
2. Share learnings with the wider medical community as your own program develops. This exchange of insights drives innovation and improves the field as a whole. You can share your experiences [here](../4.-learning-from-success-stories/4.1-share-your-experience.md).
3. Build a network of peers invested in video review. This allows for collaborative problem-solving, addressing common challenges in implementation and optimization. Take a look at our [Neoflix Community](../../level-3-growth/18.-expanding-your-video-program/18.1-revolutionize-reflection-in-medical-care-join-the-network.md).

By engaging with these resources and actively participating in the learning process, medical teams can maximize the benefits of video review. This approach not only enhances individual practice but also contributes to the overall advancement of medical care through shared knowledge and experience.
