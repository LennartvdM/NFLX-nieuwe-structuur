* **Keep it** [**simple**](3.2-simple.md)**:** Start with straightforward procedures and a user-friendly recording setup. Start with readily available technology (smartphones, tablets, basic cameras) for initial setup.
* **Start** [**small** ](3.3-small.md)**& build momentum:** Avoid overcomplicating the process early on, as enthusiasm and confidence grow, you can strategically expand the scope of your project, for example by adding audio.

Develop robust protocols for audio recording, storage, management, and deletion.
