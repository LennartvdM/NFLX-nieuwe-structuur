# LEVEL 3: GROWTH

Congratulations on successfully implementing your video review program! As your team becomes more comfortable with the process, you'll likely see them start to suggest exciting ways to expand its use. In this level, we'll focus on how video review can drive continuous improvement within your unit. We'll also explore international video review opportunities and how you can join our Neoflix Network.
