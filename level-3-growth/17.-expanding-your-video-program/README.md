#### **Unlock the Power of Shared Insights: Expanding Your Video Review Program**

Your video review program holds a wealth of valuable knowledge. Imagine the potential of sharing a video of a medical procedure with colleagues in a different unit. New perspectives, valuable insights, and shared learning experiences unfold â€“ all leading to better patient care. It's time to take your program further and explore multicenter video review. Here, two centers collaboratively review videos of procedures, using an online connection.&#x20;

#### Key Considerations:

* Institutional Support: Secure funding and IT support for infrastructure needed for broader sharing initiatives and maintenance of your video repository.
* Privacy: consider the privacy of those who are recorded, patient and provider.&#x20;

### Here's how to do it:

**Introduction:**

Multi-center video review provides a fantastic opportunity to improve medical procedures across institutions. This manual outlines a simple process for collaboration between centers and fosters shared learning for better patient outcomes.

#### **First, join our** [**Neoflix Network**](17.1-revolutionize-reflection-in-medical-care-join-the-network.md) **to connect with centers worldwide.**&#x20;

#### **Step 1: Procedure Selection and Checklist Creation**

* **Choose Procedures:** Begin by selecting specific procedures that would benefit from multicenter review (consider those with variability between centers).
* **Find Similar Recordings:** Gather recordings from both centers that showcase the chosen procedures. Ensure enough similarity to spark insightful comparisons.
* **Create the Checklist:** Collaboratively develop a checklist outlining key procedure steps of local practices. Design the checklist for easy use during the review.

**Step 2: Setting Up the Review Session**

* **Invite Participants:** Include a mix of medical and nursing staff from both centers.
* **Choose a Time:** Select a time that works conveniently for the largest number of participants
* **Technology:** Decide on a reliable virtual meeting platform (e.g., Webex, Microsoft Teams).
* **Include Case Details:** Provide contextual information regarding the cases on video (gestational age, infant weight, reason for intervention, etc.).

#### **Step 3: Conducting the Multicenter Review Session**

* **Moderation:** Designate providers from both centers as session moderators. Their role will be introducing the cases, guiding discussions, and keeping track of time.
* **Watch and Discuss:** Play the videos from both centers and facilitate open discussion on similarities and differences. Encourage participants to ask questions.
* **Update the Checklist:** Actively update the checklist during the session with new insights, ensuring it becomes a valuable reference tool.

#### **Step 4: Sharing Lessons Learned**

* **Internal Discussions:** After each session, moderators should discuss findings within their centers and implement changes as needed.
* **Document Changes:** Keep a record of practice changes inspired by your multi-center sessions. This helps track progress and identify areas for continuous improvement.

#### **Additional Tips:**

* **Emphasize a supportive environment:** Make it clear the focus is on shared learning, not competition.
